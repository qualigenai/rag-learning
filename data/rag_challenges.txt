Common Challenges in RAG Systems

1. Chunking Strategy
Choosing the right chunk size is crucial. Too small and you lose context; too large 
and you may include irrelevant information. Overlap between chunks helps maintain 
continuity but increases storage requirements.

2. Retrieval Accuracy
Not all retrieved chunks may be relevant. This can lead to:
- Context pollution: Irrelevant information confusing the LLM
- Missing information: Relevant chunks not being retrieved
- Contradictory information: Different sources providing conflicting facts

3. Latency
RAG systems involve multiple steps (embedding, search, generation) which can impact 
response time. Optimization strategies include caching, indexing, and batching.

4. Hallucinations
Even with retrieved context, LLMs may generate incorrect or unsupported information. 
This is particularly problematic when the model has low confidence or when context 
is ambiguous.

5. Context Window Limitations
LLMs have limited context windows. Fitting multiple retrieved chunks plus the query 
and system prompt requires careful management of token budgets.

6. Metadata Management
Tracking document sources, versions, timestamps, and other metadata is essential for 
transparency and debugging but adds complexity.

7. Cost Considerations
Embedding generation, vector storage, and LLM inference all incur costs. Balancing 
performance with cost efficiency is an ongoing challenge.
