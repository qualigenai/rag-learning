Oracle's RAG Implementation

Oracle has integrated RAG capabilities across multiple products:

Oracle Database 23ai with Select AI:
Oracle's flagship RAG offering automates the RAG process. Select AI creates and populates 
vector stores, performs semantic similarity searches, and augments prompts with relevant 
content from enterprise data. The system uses AI Vector Search built directly into the 
database.

Key Features:
- Native vector data type in SQL
- Hybrid search combining vectors with relational, graph, spatial, and JSON data
- DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN PL/SQL package for RAG operations
- Security: Data never leaves the Oracle Database
- Integration with multiple LLM providers

Oracle AI Vector Search:
Supports efficient similarity search using indexes like HNSW and IVF. Allows combining 
vector search with traditional SQL queries for powerful enterprise RAG applications.

OCI Generative AI Agents:
These agents augment LLM knowledge without retraining. They use hybrid search combining 
lexical and semantic approaches. Oracle Integration (OIC) helps automate the end-to-end 
RAG process with low-code/no-code platforms.

Benefits for Enterprise:
- Integrated with existing Oracle infrastructure
- Enterprise-grade security and governance
- High performance and scalability
- Multi-cloud support (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

Oracle's approach embeds RAG directly into database infrastructure rather than requiring 
external tools, providing better security and performance for enterprise applications.
