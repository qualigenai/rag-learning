What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval 
with text generation. Instead of relying solely on a language model's training data, 
RAG first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base, then uses those documents 
as context for generating answers.

The key benefit of RAG is that it allows language models to access up-to-date information 
and domain-specific knowledge without requiring expensive model retraining. This makes 
RAG particularly valuable for enterprise applications where data changes frequently.

RAG systems typically consist of several components: a document store, an embedding model 
to convert text into vectors, a vector database for efficient similarity search, and a 
language model to generate final answers based on retrieved context.
